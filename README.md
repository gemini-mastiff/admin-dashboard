# admin-dashboard

In this project I will be reating a dashboard design for a fictional app. I will be trying to mostly use CSS grid for this project. I believe it will test my design skills.

# to-do

1. Set up the layout of the page using grid
    - The main layout can be achieved with a 2x2 grid
        - The side bar will take up the whole of the left column
        - the nav and the main section will take up the remaining two cells
THE SPEC WANTS TO USE MAINLY GRID TO ACHIEVE THIS LAYOUT
